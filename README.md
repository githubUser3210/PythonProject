<!-- #Step 1: Prepare the Data

Make sure you have the R2 Score values for each dependent variable obtained from your regression models (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree).
Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual R2 Score values for each dependent variable and each model.
#Step 2: Update the Code

Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual R2 Score values for Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree models.
Adjust any other parameters in the code as needed.
#Step 3: Run the Code

Execute the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
This will generate a bar graph comparing R2 Scores for each dependent variable across the three regression models.
#Step 4: Interpret the Results

Observe the bar graph to understand the impact of each dependent variable on the performance of the three regression models.
Higher bars indicate a higher impact (better performance) for the corresponding dependent variable. -->
